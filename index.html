            <p class="timeline-sub">Senior Data Analyst</p>
            <p>
              Venturing into the healthcare realm, I constructed SQL/Python pipelines 
              that cleansed and modeled large-scale data for Elevance and Aetna, boosting 
              data accuracy by ~20%. In my junior capacity, I shouldered day-to-day planning 
              responsibilities—coordinating minor sprints, aligning tasks with the business 
              team, and ensuring that each data milestone was appropriately validated. My 
              Power BI and Tableau dashboards supported multi-million-dollar strategic 
              initiatives, improving efficiency by ~15%.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also implemented iterative transformations with dbt (a data build tool)
              to streamline data extraction, raising processing efficiency another ~15–20%.
              During this period, I learned to blend standard regression and hypothesis 
              testing (pandas, scikit-learn, SciPy) into everyday workflows, accelerating 
              data-driven decisions at the C-level. Although I was an associate-level 
              contributor, I actively planned pipeline enhancement tasks to ensure on-time 
              delivery and a coherent data journey from ingestion to final insights.

            <p>
              As a contract Senior Data Analyst working alongside a tight-knit team, 
              I focused on forecasting solutions using Python libraries like pandas, 
              scikit-learn, and XGBoost, cutting forecast errors by about 10%. 
              I introduced SAS-based accuracy checks to refine existing forecasting processes, 
              and used dbt in conjunction with Airflow on a modest AWS/Snowflake environment 
              for ~20–25% overall workflow efficiency gains.
            </p>
            <p>
              My responsibilities included running short weekly stand-ups, setting 
              small deadlines, and verifying deliverables matched stakeholder expectations.
              This experience taught me how iterative improvements and consistent 
              communication can elevate forecast fidelity—even in a local or mid-scale environment.

            <p>
              At Royal Caribbean Group, I devised SQL/Python revenue models for a fleet 
              of 26 ships, elevating demand projection accuracy by ~15–20%. I also 
              scripted Python-based ticket pricing updates, reducing manual input by ~30–40% 
              and enhancing operational efficiency by ~10–15%. In my associate role, I 
              tracked each deliverable's progress (like implementing advanced window 
              functions) in short sprints, ensuring code quality and data integrity 
              before deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
              This environment prioritized fast decisions, so I coordinated with 
              operations to confirm pipeline readiness each week. By bridging data 
              engineering tasks and simple project management duties, I helped deliver 
              near real-time fare adjustments and quickly capitalized on new 
              revenue opportunities.

              At Qvest.US, I stepped into an associate-level data analyst role supporting 
              SQL-driven data pipelines for cross-department Tableau/Power BI dashboards. 
              These pipelines fostered real-time insights for sales and operations. 
              My self-organized “micro-projects” for each enhancement ensured tasks remained

        Every dataset tells a story—sometimes it’s about shifting consumer behavior, 
        sometimes it's a pattern hidden in millions of transactions, and sometimes 
        it’s the unexpected signal buried in the noise. The projects below are deep

        advanced analytics challenges on my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each project tackles a unique problem, from forecasting demand 
        to deciphering sentiment at scale. My approach focuses on both 
        thorough methodology and real insights, demonstrating the power 
        of careful data preparation, iterative modeling, and interpretability.
      </p>

          <h3>1. Sentiment Analysis on 1.6 Million Tweets</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Project Overview:</strong> In this personal exercise, I analyzed 
            a massive repository of tweets to pinpoint the emotional tone across months 
            and topics. By cleaning raw text, extracting meaningful features, 
            and employing a logistic regression model, I set out to reveal how 
            shifting news cycles or viral hashtags influence overall sentiment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Process:</strong> Text normalization (removing emojis, punctuation, 
            and repeated characters) served as the foundation. Next, 
            I used TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) to emphasize 
            unique terms. I then trained a logistic regression classifier 
            with cross-validation, iterating on hyperparameters to maximize accuracy. 
            A separate dictionary-based approach (like VADER) was tested for comparison, 
            giving me additional context on potential misclassifications.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Results &amp; Insights:</strong> 
            The final model surpassed 90% accuracy, efficiently separating positive from 
            negative tweets. A monthly timeline revealed spikes in negativity around 
            contentious events, while neutral or slightly positive sentiment prevailed 
            in quieter periods. By overlaying retweet counts, I discovered that high-retweet 
            waves typically coincided with polarizing topics. This clarified how 
            emotionally charged content garners more engagement, shaping a social media 
            feedback loop.

          <h3>2. Time Series Forecasting for Retail Demand</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Project Overview:</strong> In this self-led exploration of demand dynamics, 
            I examined two years of retail transactions across multiple product categories. 
            My objective was to predict upcoming demand, reduce last-minute restocking costs, 
            and better align promotional calendars with actual buying patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Process:</strong> 
            First, I tackled data anomalies (like erroneous transactions, out-of-range values) 
            and introduced domain-specific features (promotional flags, day-of-week indicators, 
            rolling averages). Using an ensemble approach—combining Prophet for seasonality 
            detection and RandomForestRegressor for non-linear interactions—I validated 
            each iteration with rolling window back-testing (to ensure the model generalizes 
            well across months). Detailed evaluation of the forecast errors revealed cyclical 
            mismatches during holiday spikes, prompting me to refine short-term predictions 
            with extra holiday event variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Results &amp; Insights:</strong>
            The final ensemble slashed the mean absolute error by ~17% over a naive 
            baseline, providing reliability that empowered managers to reorder more precisely. 
            Detailed inspection of residuals confirmed that certain items remained highly 
            sensitive to spontaneous discount campaigns, while others showed stable 
            demand regardless of marketing. By capturing these nuances, 
            the retailer avoided overextending on slow-moving lines, 
            cutting overall storage expenses by about 10%.

          <h3>3. Advanced Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Project Overview:</strong> In this deep dive, I gathered session logs 
            and purchasing data from a large-scale online marketplace. By aggregating 
            user-level metrics (purchase frequency, average cart size, recency), 
            I sought to segment the customer base into distinct behavioral clusters, 
            helping tailor loyalty programs, upsell strategies, and marketing campaigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Process:</strong> 
            I began by blending session logs with transaction records, building a user-centric
            table capturing total orders, typical basket value, and average time between purchases. 
            I tested multiple clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, hierarchical) and assessed 
            them via silhouette scores (gauging cluster distinctness). K-Means with five clusters 
            struck the best balance. Each cluster was then labeled according to spending and frequency traits, 
            such as “Low Frequency, Low Spend” or “High Frequency, Mid Spend.” I monitored transitions 
            between clusters, revealing how user behavior can shift over months or after major site changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Results &amp; Insights:</strong>
            Breaking down these clusters guided marketing teams to run targeted campaigns for high-value segments, 
            raising email open rates by ~18%. Additionally, the “Occasional Big-Spender” group responded best to 
            limited-time upsell offers, while “Frequent Bargain-Hunter” users favored small but consistent discounts. 
            Observing how often a user migrated from one cluster to another gave the business earlier signals on loyalty 
            risks or growth opportunities, fine-tuning engagement efforts in real time.

            <em>Visualization: Five Clusters by Frequency &amp; Spend Level</em><br/>
            Each point in the scatter plot represents a user’s average monthly purchases (X-axis) versus 
            average spend per transaction (Y-axis). Color-coded clusters indicate unique behavioral patterns, 
            with labeled centroids to highlight the principal grouping. This multi-cluster layout exposes 
            direct contrasts—for instance, one cluster might purchase rarely yet spend a high amount, 
            while another invests in frequent but modest orders.
